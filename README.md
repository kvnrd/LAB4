# LAB4

In this lab, I had to improve the running time of the previous lab from using binary search trees to using the hash tables. The hash table created had to solve collisions by chaining. I had to write functions that determine the average number of comparisons required to perform a successful retrieve or search operation. In order to do this, I have to create different hash functions in order to compare the average number of comparisons done.
